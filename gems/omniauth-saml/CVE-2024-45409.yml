title: SAML authentication bypass via Incorrect XPath selector
date: 2024-08-28
description: |
  Ruby-SAML in <= 12.2 and 1.13.0 <= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of the SAML Response.
  An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed saml document (by the IdP) can thus forge a SAML
  Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. This would allow the attacker to log in as arbitrary user within
  the vulnerable system.
